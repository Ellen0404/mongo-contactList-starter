# Mongo/Mongoose/Express/Handlebars Budget Manager

Starter code for DU Coding Boot Camp Mongo/Handlebars Review Session.

## Getting Started

Begin by forking and cloning this repository.

During the session, we'll be working together to add functionality to create new contacts, validate contacts, filter by type, delete contacts, etc. We'll be wiring up the back-end Mongo/Mongoose model and database interactions, and the Express routing. We'll also complete the Handlebars templates and wire up front-end JavaScript to interact with the back-end.
